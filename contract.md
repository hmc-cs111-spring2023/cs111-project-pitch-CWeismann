## Goals

_At a high level, what do you most want to get out of this project, and why?_

Between PLs and this class, I've become really passionate about programming language design, and I've been 
itching for the chance to do a full design of my own. I really liked the Raskell final project from PLs, but I 
definitely found myself wanting to design my own language, which I think will improve not only my PLs skills, but 
the way I approach CS in general. I'm also really passionate about my idea for a DSL, and I feel like this project 
is something that I would consider continuing to work on in the future.

At a super high level, I've recently come to the point in my life where I'm thinking about post-college plans, 
so this will be a really good field test to see if I want to go into industry and do software development, or 
pursue a graduate degree in something like PLs research. Obviously a half-semester project won't completely help 
me pin that sort of thing down (and I still have a while to think about it), but I think my feelings on this 
project at the end of the semester will sway me one way or the other a bit more.

Finally, I really want to have this DSL as a finished product; I think it could be a great thing for the small 
board game industry that's recently (during the pandemic) been interested in moving beyond physical prototyping, 
but without all the burdens that come with software like BGA or Tabletop Simulator. Additionally, reducing the 
need for human playtesters could help things be released faster, with better balance, and for a lower budget.

## Concepts / skills

_What concepts and / or skills from class would you like to work on, as part of your
project? Are there any concepts / skills that we haven't covered in class that you would
like to work on, as part of your project (for example, other things related to DSLs that
you have come across, or topics from other classes)? Why are you interested in working on
these things?_

I've really enjoyed learning Scala, so I'm planning on using it to implement my DSL. Functional programming 
feels very fun to me, so I'm always looking for a chance to sharpen my functional programming skills; having the 
option to do a bit of imperative programming is quite nice though. My favorite part of the class so far has been 
internal DSL design, especially the lab where we wrote those cool looping programs, so I'm leaning towards an 
internal DSL right now, partially because I felt like Raskell gave me more of a chance to learn the external side 
of language implementation. I feel like this class elevated my understanding of what OOP can be, so I'm also 
excited to dig deeper into Scala's OOP features.

Additionally, I think it will be really good to implement something that *isn't* aimed at computer science 
people, since it will really force me to create a design that is as human-friendly and easy to learn as possible. 
If I have time, I'd ideally like to do some usability testing on my language, and have a few other people try to 
use it, but that might be a project for another time. I think usability testing is something that is very 
important in software development, but something that CS classes don't often teach, so I think it will be a great 
skill to pick up. I also need practice writing README files and code documentation, and I'm certain this project
will help with that.

## Time management plan

_How do you plan to set aside time outside of class, to work on the project? Are there
intermediate milestones that you can create, to help you make consistent progress?_

I'm really passionate about this project, so I doubt that I will struggle with finding time to work on the 
project, and I'm willing to drop Programming Practicum if I find that I need the time to make my project 
really great. As you noted in your feedback on my original project plan, I'll probably need to create a sort 
of minimum viable product first, probably a system that allows the user to program games playable with a deck 
of cards, then build up from there.

My plan is to slowly look at more and more complex games, and figure out what makes them not possible on my 
current iteration of the language, then add new features that makes it possible, e.g. Hearts -> Poker -> Chess -> 
Catan -> Agricola -> Root, or something like that. If I find success fairly early, I'm confident that there are a 
lot of ways to build on this project to make it more user friendly, so I doubt that the scale of this project will 
be too small or that I'll finish early.

Scheduling-wise, I'll probably assess what I need to do for the week during in-class worktime on Monday, read
through Tuesday's feedback in class on Wednesday and modify my plan, then do the bulk of my work during the day
on Wednesday night and Saturday, stretching over into Sunday if I'm feeling particularly passionate or am stuck
on something.

## Teamwork plan

_If you plan to work with someone else on the project, what is your plan for
collaborating? What part(s) do you think you might do together? What part(s) are you
considering doing separately? How will you hold one another accountable to make regular
progress?_

N/A

## Critique plan

_What will you do to make sure that you can give consistent and actionable feedback to
other people in the class?_

I've really enjoyed the critique process so far, both giving and receiving feedback on my previous homeworks, 
so I don't think I'll lack the motivation to do it. I've found that reading other people's Scala code has really 
improved my own ability to write Scala, so I'm betting that I'll actually be excited to look through others' code, 
as it will help me make my own DSL better. Honestly, I'm more worried about *receiving* feedback from others, as 
I'm oftentimes pretty bad at documenting my own code; hopefully this will be my time to finally bite the bullet 
and write good comments.

More pragmatically, I'll probably continue the system I've used since the start of the semester, where I have 
certain days set aside specifically to work on my homework and critiques, although I'll have to change those days 
based on the new due dates, probably to Monday evenings for my critiques (see above for my homework schedule 
plan). I felt like my feedback has been pretty good so far, and I think it will improve even  more on a 
large-scale project, as there will be so much more to address.

## Success

_At the end of the semester, what would you be proud to show or tell someone about your
project?_

Honestly, being able to show them two radically different games, like Poker and Chess, programmed in my 
language would be really cool. The human-centered aspects are really important to me as well: if I could show this 
to someone who knows almost nothing about programming and have them instinctively understand how programs in my 
language are written, I would count that as a complete success.

If I have an even semi-functional text-based UI that can output enough information about a game state in a 
readable fashion, I would be over the moon. In CS5, my final project was a version of Uno playable in the 
terminal, with little ASCII-art cards shown in your hand; it would be particularly fitting if my final project for 
this class allowed nearly any game to be created in a similar way.

Especially to non-CS majors, telling people I wrote my own programming language often blows their minds, so it 
would be fun to say I've designed my own now too.

## Assessment

_Looking over your responses to the previous questions, what would you consider to be an
"A-" for your project? What would you consider to be an "A"?_

It's hard to know how difficult different aspects of the language will be to design and implement; however, I 
think an "A-" level project will be one that is very approachable for non-computer scientists. I know that a "B+" 
level project is one that is "well-packaged for someone else to understand it", but designing a language so that 
someone without any CS background poses a particular problem, so I think a particularly approachable design will elevate the quality of my project. Whether or not the implementation is completely done, a well-designed, accessible language that theoretically could support a fair selection of games is "A-" level work.

An "A" level project is less about specific features of the language, and more about the amount of work that 
I'll be putting in to the project. If it seems like I've passionately engaged with the project, especially its 
design, for more time than would be expected each week, I feel that that is "A" level work. Since every project is 
different, it's hard to qualify a grade on a project's level of polish or implementation completeness; however, 
the cleanness of the design and *quality* of the implementation are key indicators that the person working on it 
took a lot of time making the project as good as they can. This feels to me similar to how art classes are often
graded; not on the art's perfection, per se, but on the artist's commitment.
